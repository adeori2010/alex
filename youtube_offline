    Run curl -L https://github.com/Tzahi12345/YoutubeDL-Material/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml to download the latest Docker Compose, or go to the releases page to grab the version you'd like.
    Run docker-compose pull. This will download the official YoutubeDL-Material docker image.
    Run docker-compose up to start it up. If successful, it should say "HTTP(S): Started on port 17443" or something similar. This tells you the container-internal port of the application. Please check your docker-compose.yml file for the external port. If you downloaded the file as described above, it defaults to 8998.
    Make sure you can connect to the specified URL + external port, and if so, you are done!
