steps

    download the iso file that suits you most on Android-x86.org
        I use android-x86_64-8.1-r4.iso this time. It is Android 8.1(Oreo) for 64-bit windows. about 868 MB

    create a new virtual machine on VMware
        choose I will install the operating system later
        Next, you will be required to select the guest operating system. Choose Other Linux 4.x
        enter whatever name of your machine and the directory you’d like to save it.
        Harddisk: either use the suggested size (8 GB), or any amount. (I use 24 GB this time)
        Click Customize Hardware
            RAM: suggested >= 1 GB (I use 16 GB this time because I’ve got plenty of RAM)
            CPU: at least 1 core (I use 4)
        Mount the iso file via setting CD/DVD (IDE)
        select tab Display and enable Accelerate 3D Graphics
        than close the setting and start the VM

        Advanced options...
        then Auto_Installation
        it will warn you such installation will erase the disk, just go because we’re working on a dedicated VM for it.
        After successful installation, Disconnect the CD/DVD on the top-right tool bar of VMware. then choose Reboot.
