Alternative Install Methods

Piping to bash is controversial, as it prevents you from reading code that is about to run on your system. Therefore, we provide these alternative installation methods which allow code review before installation:
Method 1: Clone our repository and run

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole.git Pi-hole
cd "Pi-hole/automated install/"
sudo bash basic-install.sh
