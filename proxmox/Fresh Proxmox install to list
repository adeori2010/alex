Step 2 - Install Proxmox


Step 3 - Increase Storage

1. Delete the local-lvm directory

2. Delete local-lvm from CLI:

lvremove /dev/pve/data

3. Reallocate the space

lvresize -l +100%FREE /dev/pve/root

To mount a USB drive containing data to a Proxmox VE server, follow these steps:

Run the following command to list all connected drives and identify the USB drive:
```sh
lsblk
```
Look for your USB drive in the output. It will typically be something like `/dev/sdX` (where `X` is a letter like `a`, `b`, etc.).

### 3. Create a Mount Point

Create a directory where you want to mount the USB drive. For example:
```sh
mkdir /mnt/usb
```

### 4. Mount the USB Drive

Mount the USB drive to the directory you created. Replace `/dev/sdX1` with the appropriate device identifier for your USB drive (the partition number might be different):
```sh
mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/usb
```

### 5. Verify the Mount

Check that the USB drive is mounted correctly by listing the contents of the mount point:
```sh
ls /mnt/usb
```
You should see the files and directories from your USB drive.

### 6. Add the USB Drive to Proxmox Storage (Optional)

If you want Proxmox to recognize the USB drive as a storage location, you can add it via the Proxmox web interface:

1. Go to the Proxmox web interface.
2. Navigate to **Datacenter** -> **Storage**.
3. Click **Add** and choose the storage type (Directory or other appropriate type).
4. Configure the storage by specifying the mount point (`/mnt/usb`) and other required settings.
5. Click **Add** to save the storage configuration.

### 7. Unmount the USB Drive (When Finished)

When you are done using the USB drive, unmount it with the following command:
```sh
umount /mnt/usb
```
You can then safely remove the USB drive from the server.

By following these steps, you can mount and use a USB drive containing data on your Proxmox VE server.
