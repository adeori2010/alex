#Installing Searx search engine in docker

git clone https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker.git

#If you are using a public server you can adjust the content of the .env file
Now use nano to edit the file if you are using a public server and want to use a custom hostname or if you want to add an email so it can make you an SSL certificate.Â 

#**If you do not have a custom hostname, put in your IP address in the "SEARX_HOSTNAME" field and leave the "LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL" commented out**


nano .env


#Once you are done exit the file using Ctrl+X hit "Y" and then "Enter"


#Run this command to generate a super secret key

sed -i "s|ultrasecretkey|$(openssl rand -hex 32) |g" searxng/settings.yml


#Now to start SearX run this command

sudo docker-compose up -d


You should see the output below

Once you see this output, you are good to start up Searx!

sudo docker-compose up -d

Now throw your IP address in to your browser's address bar and you should be able to access your Searx search engine!
